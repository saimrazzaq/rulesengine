2. Dependencies

i. JAVA Development Environment
You can download latest from https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. Add it to class path.

Usually the ide like intellij and eclipse have junit support but if you want to download it as jar you can use the link below
https://jar-download.com/artifact-search/junit5 and add it in build path.

This is google's json parser. The jar file is located in the project. If you are using an ide, you should add it using buildpath->add
external jar.

3. To Run Tests
   Right click on Tests.java(file type junit) file and run as Junit. There are 10 tests that will show as pass or fail.

4. I have added a new rule in rules.json i.e. if a person's state is hawaii, then add 0.2 to interest rate.
